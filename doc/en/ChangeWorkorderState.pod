=head1 NAME

ChangeWorkorderState - Change state of workorders based on their planned end time and change
state of the change based on the 'last' workorder.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This addon adds a cronjob that checks if the planned end time of a workorder has passed. If
so, the workorder state is set to I<delayed>. If the delayed workorder is the "last" workorder
of a change, the change state is set to I<delayed>.

You can also set an "available time / effort ratio". If you have set a planned effort of 5 hours
and there are already 3 hours accounted, there are 2 hours left. If the planned end time of the
workorder is in 2.5 hours and you configured a ratio of 60%, the workorder state will be set
to I<delayed>.

After installation you have to activate the cronjob that checks the workorders.
